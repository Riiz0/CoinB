## Overview

Bunime is a community-powered ecosystem that unites the love of bunnies and anime into a single, exciting project. Operating on Binance and Polygon Networks, Bunime ensures fast transaction speeds, lower gas fees, and increased security and decentralization.

## Utility

Bunime is a Crypto Meme Community Anime Token that allows users to engage in various activities within the Bunime ecosystem. By supporting the Bunime community through transaction fees, users contribute to the spread of love for bunnies and anime. Users can buy, sell, and trade BUNI tokens on supported platforms, with the value of BUNI tokens continuously updated according to market fluctuations. Additionally, users can mint BUNINFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing unique bunny and anime-related items, which can be sold or traded on the Polygon and Binance Networks.

## Multi-Chain Token

Bunime is integrated with Binance, Polygon and Bitcoin networks. This multi-network approach ensures fast transaction speeds, lower gas fees, and increased security and decentralization. It also provides users with flexibility to choose the network that best suits their needs.

The BUNI token follows the BRC-20 standard, which is a novel token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain. This standard allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, expanding its utility into the realms of tokenization and decentralized finance.
BRC-20 tokens are fungible digital assets created on the Bitcoin blockchain. These tokens are unique because they are inscribed directly onto Bitcoinâ€™s satoshis using JSON code, making them distinct from traditional tokens on platforms like Ethereum. The BRC-20 standard offers a new way to utilize Bitcoin, allowing for the creation and transfer of tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## BUNINFTs

BUNINFTs are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing unique bunny and anime-related items. These NFTs are minted on the Ethereum network, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade them on platforms like OpenSea. The creators of the NFT collections receive a 6% royalty fee for their work.

### `NFT Collections`
Bunime also offers NFT collections based on anime, providing users with unique digital collectibles. These collections are available on the Binance and Bitcoin networks, offering users the opportunity to engage with their favorite anime characters in a new way.

## Tokenomics

The tokenomics of Bunime are designed around a deflationary mechanism and a transaction fee system. A transaction fee is applied to every transfer of BUNI tokens, set at 1% of the transaction amount, split between the sender and the recipient. Half of the fee goes to the developer of the contract, and the other half is burned, effectively removing it from circulation. This deflationary mechanism helps to control the overall supply of BUNI tokens and potentially increase their value over time.

### `Total Supply`
The total supply of BUNI tokens is capped at 69,420,000,000 tokens. This is a fixed supply model, meaning that no more tokens will be minted once this limit is reached. This model is designed to control the token's scarcity and potentially increase its value over time.

## Trust and Security
Bunime places a high emphasis on trust and security. It employs effective identity management and permissions to build trusted networks, ensuring secure transactions within the Bunime ecosystem. Furthermore, Bunime is committed to regulatory compliance and prioritizes strong consumer protections.
